# Image classification with MLP
The aim of the project is to create an image classification algorithm using the MLP neural network in Tensorflow. The project uses an exemplary set of data (images) CIFAR-10 available in Keras

The CIFAR10 dataset contains 60,000 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images in each class. The dataset is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.The names of the image classes are 'airplane', 'automobile', 'bird', 'cat', 'deer', 'dog', 'frog', 'horse', 'ship', 'truck'.
